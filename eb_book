Eb is software that helps one study a subject, by allowing the user to create and review flashcards.

It has the following options:

1) Creating a new deck
2) Adding cards to the deck
3) Reviewing cards
4) Editing cards
5) Deleting cards
6) Changing the study options

3) Reviewing cards
By default, whenever the time comes that cards need to be reviewed, the showReviewingPanel method is invoked. This sets the MainWindowState 
to REVIEWING, and calls the start method of ReviewManager. When that is done, it uses switchToPanel to switch to the reviewing panel. 
This calls the start() method of the ReviewManager singleton

If the last review has been made, the program state is updated to SUMMARIZING, and the summarizing panel is shown.

Glossary:
MainWindowState: what is the state of the main window? Is it REACTIVE (=waiting for the timer to indicate that a card needs to be reviewed)
